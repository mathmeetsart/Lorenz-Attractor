# Lorenz Attractor

Welcome to the Lorenz Attractor repository! Explore the mesmerizing world of chaotic systems and artistic visualization.
<br/><br/><br/>

## Description

The Lorenz Attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to a system of ordinary differential equations. It was first studied by Edward Lorenz in the 1960s as a simplified model of atmospheric convection. Despite its simplicity, the Lorenz Attractor exhibits complex behavior known as deterministic chaos.

For more information, you can refer to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system).

## Visual Appeal and Artistic Representation

The intricate patterns and unpredictable trajectories of the Lorenz Attractor make it visually captivating. Artists and mathematicians alike are drawn to its chaotic nature, using it as inspiration for various forms of artistic expression, including digital art and sculptures.
<br/><br/><br/>

## Applications

Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Lorenz Attractor has practical applications in various fields, including weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, and cryptography. Its chaotic behavior makes it valuable for studying complex systems and phenomena.
<br/><br/><br/>

## Code

Explore the code used to generate visualizations of the Lorenz Attractor. The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as matplotlib and numpy.
<br/>

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
<br/>

### Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `lorenz_attractor.py` file.
2. Make sure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `lorenz_attractor.py`.
5. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python lorenz_attractor.py
    ```

6. The script will generate a 3D plot of the Lorenz attractor and display it in a new window.
<br/>

### Customization

You can customize the behavior of the attractor by modifying the parameters and initial conditions in the `lorenz` function:

- `s`: The Prandtl number, controlling the strength of fluid viscosity.
- `r`: The Rayleigh number, controlling the intensity of thermal convection.
- `b`: The geometric factor, controlling the shape of the attractor.

You can also adjust the step size (`dt`) and number of steps (`num_steps`) in the simulation loop to change the resolution and duration of the simulation.

To customize the appearance of the plot, you can modify the plotting section in the script. For example, you can change the color and thickness of the lines, set the background color, or save the plot as an image file.
