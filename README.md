# Lorenz Attractor

Welcome to the Lorenz Attractor repository! Explore the mesmerizing world of chaotic systems and artistic visualization.

## Description

The Lorenz Attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to a system of ordinary differential equations. It was first studied by Edward Lorenz in the 1960s as a simplified model of atmospheric convection. Despite its simplicity, the Lorenz Attractor exhibits complex behavior known as deterministic chaos.

For more information, you can refer to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system).
